1. Gitter [rooms](https://gitter.im/scala/scala) - beginner friendly
2. [scala_ru](https://t.me/scala_ru) - Russian, could be toxic once in a while, but still nice.

## Some resources
- ! https://github.com/alexandru/scala-best-practices <- keep an eye on best practices, there are decent expalations for "Why?" questions as well
- https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala <- First one quite tedious, second and next are much better, but you need some knowledge to that, a good book could be a great start

## General recommendations
- Environment: Intellij with Scala plugin are quite nice. VS Code with Metals plugin super as well. Eclipse Scala IDE seems a bit outdated to me.
- Be patient, don't expect that you'll know everything after one book or course, Scala is a scale, you'll have something to learn for some time. ;)  
- Experienced buddy in Scala or any other functional language could help you a lot, or you can ask any questions in Scala gitter channels as well.
